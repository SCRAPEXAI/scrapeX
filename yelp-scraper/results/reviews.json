I will say it felt slightly cold and on the darker side but the service was great and the food came out fast. \n\nI will say my burger felt slightly greasy but I like my burgers medium rare overall, so maybe that's why. If you're a sports fan, then they've got several TVs on with games of all sorts. \n\nI would come back and try something else for sure!",

List of cocktails is plentiful and goes by spirits (3 or 4 options for each spirit) that I believe they distill at the restaurant? Wonderful service by Chris who made sure we were comfortable throughout the meal. I had the Walla Walla burger that was delicious, but the pasta is absolutely to die for!

      "full": "I'm literally still salivating thinking about that pasta I ate and I am currently contemplating driving there right now for more while writing this review. I'm usually quite particular about my pastas, but I haven't stopped talking about this place with my boyfriend since we left. We headed to to Von's for a late night dinner around 10:30pm and called ahead to see if they had spots. It was easy to find street parking across the restaurant around this time, but usually theres no parking garage/spot nearby during the day. When we walked in, we were greeted by a really kind hotness who said they weren't busy and could seat us right away. They were doing rotation, so seats were as is at that time. Our server let us know everything's made to order and last call was at 11:30pm for bar & food. The ambiance of the restaurant was intimate and chill with the dim lights. The brightest part was the liquor shelving by the bar and there's quite an extensive inventory. There didn't seem to be a dress code with people dressing up for date night or down in sweats for a quick drink. They have a fun little board they spin during happy hour for discounts off certain drinks. During dinner time, it's not too loud though which I appreciated. \n\nWe ordered separate entrees and drinks this time around. \npepperoni sour dough pizza: the cheese pull with this pizza was insane! the first bite my boyfriend took was well balanced he said the pepperoni had a nice lingering of spice. The toppings were also well distributed and the dough tasted fresh. It was more of a thin crust. \n\nmediterranean sourdough pasta w/ dog island mushroom: i could eat this every week and not get sick of it. I often feel like pasta sauces are under seasoned, but the red sauce was well salted and had a little kick too. I asked for additional red pepper flakes and that hit the spot. The pasta i could tell was also cooked fresh and I loved the texture/shape. The sun dried tomatoes add a nice texture as well as the mushrooms I added in. There's fresh basil on top and acidity from the kalamata olive cuts through each bite. \n\nstrawberry lemonade: I cannot recommend this enough!!!! I love lemonade, but usually when I order it at restaurants, it's way too sour for my liking or just taste like diabetes. I felt like this drink was a good balance of tang and fresh strawberries were refreshing. It's also a huge portion and they don't offer refills, but took me until the end of dinner to finish it anyways.\n\nside piece: I forgot to take a picture of this drink, but my boyfriend didn't like this too much. It was too harsh on his palate and wasn't giving any of the fruit notes we were expecting. \n\nI would definitely recommend this place for their food and will be back ourselves. The service hasn't been the best both times we went: the first time, it was during peak hours so understandable, but we felt rushed and ignored during our meal. Then the second time, our server was a bit too aggressive.. that's why I would give this more of a 4.6 star; service aside, I enjoyed the ambiance w/ my pasta & lemonade :)",

I mean, I've seen some impressive bartenders in my time, but these two take the cake (or should I say, the cocktail)!\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the happy hour - it was like a magical potion of joy and discounted drinks. I don't know how they do it, but Taylor and Erick managed to turn an ordinary evening into a fabulous fiesta! And the drinks? Oh boy, they were so tasty that I almost wanted to order one of each just to taste the rainbow of flavors. I'm pretty sure they secretly sprinkle a little bit of unicorn dust in every glass.\n\nNow, let's not forget the atmosphere - it was as lively as a pack of party animals on a Friday night! I don't know if it was Taylor and Erick's magnetic personalities or just the fact that they make drinks that are pure liquid happiness, but the place was buzzing with good vibes.\n\nOverall, my experience with Taylor and Erick at Vons 1000 Spirits was nothing short of amazing. They're like the Batman and Robin of bartending - except instead of fighting crime, they're fighting sobriety! If you want a good time, tasty drinks, and an atmosphere that feels like a non-stop party, look no further than these two maestros of mixology. Cheers to Taylor and Erick - you both were absolutely fabulous!!",

They only serve one type of pasta in different dishes. We ordered the cheesy macaroni and was a little bit on the dry side. I expecting it to be more creamy.\n\nSeafood stew was really good. Had chunks of fish and clams.  It was complimented with a couple of garlic bread.  Wanted more.  \n\nI also ordered the calamari which was good, but not as crispy as I was hoping.

It did not disappoint--the experience was excellent from beginning to end. I enjoyed the pepper chicken sandwich, a truly unique creation with flavors that really worked well together. Fries were great as well. Servers and greeters were extremely friendly and attentive throughout the whole meal. I enjoyed it so much that I immediately recommended Vons to my in-laws who live in the area and will continue to recommend it to any friends visiting Seattle.",

They're always so accommodating to give us good seating when we're there with our infant (somewhere in the corner near the restroom which works great for us). If ever in doubt where to eat when you're downtown, this is the place for sure. I'm sure if they're busy, the wait time won't be too bad (like I said it's pretty big).\n\nBy the looks of it, peak time on the weekend is 1:15pm-2:30pm. We got in around 12:30pm and there was plenty of seating. Started getting full around 1:15pm. \n\nThe calamari and vegan pasta tasted so good!!\nThe king salmon signature salad was okay...The salmon itself was delicious but I think the salad wasn't amazing. Happy I tried it - just won't repeat it.",

As a Washington resident, customers get a 25% discount, which our servers have always told us about as we ordered. Cody did not mention the discount, nor did he ask if we were from the area. After we paid the bill, we realized the discount was missing. When we brought this up to Cody, he condescendingly told us that it's printed on the menu and WE have to bring it up. Funny, that's not how it's worked the 19 other times. He said he could still honor it, but his attitude did a complete 180 from friendly and helpful to nasty (slapping the receipt on the table and not making eye contact). On our way out, he condescendingly sneered \"have a nice day\" in a tone that absolutely did not fit the message \n\nMind you we had been nothing but kind through this entire situation ‍",

The real treat was the sourdough pizza and pasta. My favorite dishes I ate my entire weekend in Seattle. I will dream of the Tellicherry Chicken and Smoked Gouda Pasta because it was that good !! I wish we could've come back twice during our trip. The portions were huge and we had plenty of leftovers. Highly suggest making a reservation and coming here",

Vons is an everyday, every persons, every occasion type of joint. Get out those designer jeans, stay in those Mephisto slippers, pull out the old prom dress, or get your sportcoat and tie out because you're going in for some drinking and tapas.

The bacon chunks caught me by surprise but overall still a great meal. The cherry Manhattan was a bit too sweet for my liking but luckily for me the Monday special was traditional manhattans, so of course I indulged. The traditional manhattan was a crowd favorite and made with love. Highly recommend this place for drinks, ambience, and food. The service was also excellent.",
