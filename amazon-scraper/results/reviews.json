    "text": "As an avid gamer, I recently got my hands on the highly anticipated Sony PlayStation 5, and it has truly exceeded my expectations in terms of gaming performance, immersive experiences, and next-generation capabilities.Let\u2019s start with the hardware. The PlayStation 5 showcases a sleek and futuristic design that stands out in any gaming setup. The console boasts impressive power under the hood, thanks to its custom AMD Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 GPU. This powerful combination delivers stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, and faster load times, making for an unparalleled gaming experience. Whether you\u2019re exploring vast open worlds, engaging in intense multiplayer battles, or enjoying graphically demanding titles, the PlayStation 5 handles it all with ease.One of the standout features of the PlayStation 5 is its ultra-fast solid-state drive (SSD). This SSD drastically reduces load times, allowing for near-instantaneous game loading and seamless transitions between levels. It not only enhances convenience but also immerses players deeper into the gaming world by eliminating lengthy waiting periods.The DualSense wireless controller is a game-changer in itself. Its adaptive triggers and haptic feedback technology offer a new level of immersion and interactivity. The adaptive triggers provide varying levels of resistance, adding a realistic touch to actions like pulling a bowstring or accelerating a vehicle. The haptic feedback technology delivers precise and nuanced vibrations, making in-game actions and events feel more lifelike and engaging. It\u2019s a remarkable innovation that enhances the overall gaming experience and sets the PlayStation 5 apart from its predecessors.Another notable feature of the PlayStation 5 is its backward compatibility. It allows players to enjoy a vast library of PlayStation 4 games, preserving their existing game collections while also providing access to the new and exciting titles developed specifically for the PlayStation 5. This compatibility ensures a smooth transition to the next generation, offering gamers a wide range of options to choose from.The PlayStation 5\u2019s user interface is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly. Navigating through menus, accessing games, and managing settings are all seamless and straightforward. The console also provides a range of multimedia features, such as streaming apps and 4K Blu-ray playback, making it a versatile entertainment hub for your living room.While the PlayStation 5 delivers exceptional gaming experiences, it\u2019s worth noting that availability can be a challenge due to high demand. However, once you have it in your hands, it\u2019s undoubtedly a flagship gaming console that delivers on its promise of next-generation gaming.In conclusion, the Sony PlayStation 5 is a true powerhouse of gaming technology. With its impressive hardware, lightning-fast SSD, immersive controller, backward compatibility, and user-friendly interface, it provides an unmatched gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of what\u2019s possible. If you\u2019re a dedicated gamer looking to embrace the future of gaming, the PlayStation 5 is an absolute must-have that will take your gaming adventures to new heights.",

    "text": "MAY 11, 2023+ Controller design is sleek ... smaller buttons. Easier to hit what you want.+ Share, Options and PS buttons have a profile. No more groping for them. (Hate the flush PS4 buttons.)+ The on-screen keyboard is greatly improved. Much easier & faster.+ And finally ... the graphics. *chef's kiss*  It's like I have a new TV. Not exaggerating. Vibrant & crisp. I wasn't prepared for how beautiful games look. Didn't touch TV settings. Just plugged in the PS5 and voila! Games that I always had trouble with reading text are a thing of the past. Everything on screen is crystal clear.Had the PS5 shipped in Amazon packing for obvious reasons but was uneasy based on comments.  Was sitting outside waiting when the driver arrived and placed the box next to me.  The tape was mostly pulled away from the top flaps. One side of the box was torn and the PS5 box was clearly visible.  My heart sank. Happily, I received a pristine PS5.  The Sony box doesn't have a mark or dent on it. The seal was intact and everything inside was untouched. (Sadly, the literature is in Spanish & French only.  Oops!)  The console booted normally and plays discs perfectly. Encountered none of the issues others recently described.This is truly money well spent. If you game a lot and want a better experience but haven't managed to pull the trigger, I say go for it!  I'm so happy with this console. It's absolutely better than PS4 and not just a little bit. I've been very happy with my PS4 and didn't expect wonders but the PS5 is a significant step up.==============================================================================TIPSIf your brand new PS5 isn't reading discs, don't panic. The optical scanner is on the outside of the slot, meaning that you must face the label in towards the console. For most people, it's counterintuitive. I unwittingly put the first disc in backwards and thought I had a console with a bad reader.  Nope.  It works fine. (Read June 6, 2023 update below regarding optical reader!)The UI on the PS5 is NOT like PS4.  If you can't seem to get to the main menu, which they call the Control Center, hit the PS button twice.  (some screens only require that you press it once)Do not put your PS5 on a base with 'cooling fans' in it.  The PS5 pulls air in at the top and vents at the bottom. Bases with fans blow the hot air up and overheat the console. PS5 definitely does not run as hot as PS4. As long as there's breathing space around the PS5, it should be fine.Crashing - It's not constant but there's no way around it, especially if you're playing games that were originally created for PC. While PS5 is better than PS4 at rendering graphics, no PlayStation has the chops to render graphics like PCs with high end GPUs. The only PS games that have ever crashed on me are PC games that were ported to PlayStation. Happily, I've never lost data due to crashes.===================================================================Update June 6, 2023:Today one of my CD games (Stray) tried to update. The console kept throwing an error code (CE-10005-6) that it couldn't read the disc. It's a new disc with no scratches or fingerprints. Moreover, the PS5 read this disc/installed the game the day I received the console.  I knew it wasn't a disc issue so I laid the console on its side. Lo and behold, this time the PS5 read the disc.  Reader issue.",

    "text": "When I saw this for $510, essentially getting $50-$60 off God of War Ragnarok, I was very happy. I missed the original PS4 era and only recently got one second-hand to play all the Playstation exclusives. I blasted through them all and then was ready for PS5 exclusives like Rift Apart.-Having been a past digital-only console owner on the Xbox side, I will say this -- I believe in the advantages of physical games. Yes, most game disks currently only hold an access key to play a game and not the actual files for the game itself, BUT having a disk means having more options. You can resell a disk. You can hold it physically in your hand. You can trade it with friends. And, sort of a big thing -- if you ever lose your account for some reason, YOU DON'T LOSE ALL THE DIGITAL GAMES tied to your account.-My advice is don't get sucked into digital gaming just because it's cheaper to initially get a Series S or a digital PS5. You won't physically own any license keys to the games if you go digital. If Microsoft of PS5 servers or accounts ever go down, all your stuff gets lost. They already hold our game saves hostage -- remember when you used to be able to put saves on a flashdrive and not have them tied to your account? -- so don't let them hold your actual games hostage, too. This is my advice for a lot of media nowadays. Buy hard copies. Movies, music, games, books -- all of it. Otherwise, you're essentially paying ownership-level prices to rent electronically.-Why am I fine with a digital code for Ragnarok in this bundle? It is annoying -- I'd rather have a disk, BUT you can't get a disk for this game right now at the price of $10 (assuming you buy this bundle at the sale price of $510). If you're itching to play Ragnarok right now and feel like it's the right time to upgrade, this is the best deal. I imagine Ragnarok won't ever be on sale for $10 -- PS4 God of War still sells for like $20 by comparison, so this bundle is a great deal.-Not Amazon's fault, but I feel iffy about the white plastic. It looks cool and futuristic, but white plastic can get gross over time. I would suggest keeping the console and controller out of direct sunlight and having regular (gentle) cleanings. Not sure how I feel about protective decals at this time, but that middle black plastic bar of the console scratches super easily, so I'd say maybe consider a center decal sooner rather than later.--My console arrived neatly, not really anything to note. One white panel on it seems to have a faint scratch or mould mark, but it didn't really bother me or take away from the PS5 experience.-Hope this helps you all! Trying to give my honest opinion as someone who adores all sorts of games and all sorts of consoles. Good luck!",

It gives great performance that I was not expecting. At first, I wasn\u2019t too sure about the controller layout, since I have been an Xbox player my whole life, but when I got the hang of it I loved it. The controller has so many cool features, like the microphone, the speaker, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and the touchpad. And the exclusives? Those are so good! Spiderman miles morales was amazing, GOW ragnarok was great, and I loves Kratos\u2019s character development for his son. I started playing horizen forbidden west, and I\u2019m about 8 hours in. So far, it\u2019s a great game! But yeah, I love the ps5 and would definitely give it a 10/10",

    "text": "If there's a chance for you to order one of these and get 1-Day shipping, I highly recommend that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition and it worked amazingly well out-of-the-box. Overall 5 stars.In case there are any buyers out there that want one of these and are new to how they work, or want to know how to set it up best for their family, here are some things to know:1. The God of War Ragnark\u00f6k game comes as a digital code, so expect that versus the physical game (I thought it would be a disc, but that's probably because my expectations of bundles are still stuck in the PS3 era). I redeemed my code, but I've not loaded the game yet (when it's nearly 100 GB, I'm going to wait on this until I've earned the Platinum of Final Fantasy VII Remake).2. The controller works REALLY well and the charging cord is efficient, though if you can get a dedicated charging stand, that wouldn't hurt since the cord can sometimes be finicky. I think these can be purchased for $25ish, so if you have the cash to spare, that's a worthwhile addition (it also apparently helps the battery life of the controller).3. If you're new to how the PS5 works, here's one thing to keep in mind: PS5 games can only be played if they're stored in Console Storage. If you plug in an external drive, PS5 games stored there cannot be played. Doing that just saves you the hassle of reinstalling them. From what I under, internal storage is expandable, but you need to buy a special hard drive chip-thing dedicated for the PS5 to make this work. I've not invested in this yet, so if you stick to the storage you have, prioritize the PS5 games you want to play.3.5. If you use an external drive, have that be dedicated to your old PS4 games. They'll play like a dream.4. When it came to transferring console data, it was done within an evening for me. If you're starting fresh on the console, don't worry, but if you are transferring data from a PS4, expect to play your games to be playable in about 2-4 hours. Make sure to look up guides if you've never done the transfer before. Videos are also really good resources, too. Also, definitely use an ethernet cable to help with the process.5. Make sure Game Sharing is turned on if you have a family. This is buried in the settings, but if you find it, this will allow you to have the various profiles play the games the others have bought. Save you money from re-buying a game all over again.6. The disc drive can run loud when it's first loading up the game. It'll make you wonder, \"is it ok?!\" Don't worry. It is actually ok.Those are the big things I think are handy to be aware of before buying one of these. Overall, I have no complaints. It's done everything I've wanted it to and it's helped my brothers and I play together far more easily.",

    "text": "PS5Why it's great:1. UHD, QHD and FHD graphics brilliantly rendered at 60Hz (or higher with a pricey 120Hz monitor); more solid, seamless and textured characters and environments than ever to achieve greater immersion experiences2. Load times of 12-20 seconds for AAA games. No more minutes of waiting to play GTA, Witcher or COD.  Totally surpasses the PS4. PS4 compatible games load even faster and run smoother.2. Exclusives (God of War, FF VII remake, Gran Turismo, Demon Souls remake, Ratchet & Clank, Spider Man) , compatible with PS4 titles, AAA, indy and casual titles3. Transfer PS4 data4. Controller feels great, looks great, and battery-free; haptic feature simulates the feel of on-screen action (can be turned off)5. OS is easy and logical to use functions and apps quickly, voice command6. Fairly quiet, doesn't sound like a jet engine.7. Cross-play - play with PC and Xbox owners for certain titles, not all of themWhere it needs improvement:1. Size - as big or bigger than the PS32. Price - purchase, taxes, and one new game will cost near $600. Game are $65-70 in some cases.3. Online - online games restricted without PS Plus.4. Backwards compatibility - PS4 games only. PS3, 2 and 1 won't run.5. SSD is great but quickly fills up if you play lots of AAA games.6. Design - designed like a thick binder that's coming apart, not that it affects anything besides decor aesthetics7. Voice command - handles basic commands but can't do specific things like \"Load Gran Turismo\"",

    "text": "Short review!I'm not going to review the Amazon selection or delivery process. I'm just going to briefly review about why I upgraded to a PS5!First the negative....... my PRO was compact and reasonably designed in a flat symmetrical style......  The PS5 throws out the space saving rule book in favor of waves and advanced looking style and it'll not fit where your PS4 PRO was if it was in a tight space.Be aware that although the PS4 and PS4 PRO had 4K HDMI output for games, those PS4 models were limited to playing only 1080 Blu-Ray or regular definition DVDs.  The PS4 will not play 4K Blu-Ray disks. Why Sony left that feature out, who knows!  The good news is the PS5 DVD deck plays 4K movies to their full resolution. (as well of course as Blu-Ray 1080 and lower resolution/standard def DVDs). Now I only need my PS5 in the living room to cover it all rather then the 4K blu-ray player I had to use along with my PS4 PRO.I own several PS4 games and have yet to purchase any PS5 games.Let me say that my PS4 games play better on the PS5 then they did on the PS4 PRO. Graphics are superior, speed to access any menu or just in game play is much faster and these PS4 games take on a new and improved view on screen on my 65\" 4K hdtv!I can only imagine how great games specifically designed for the PS5 will be to view and play.My initial perspective on the PS5 compared to my PS4 PRO is that although the body design for the PS5 sacrifices space and fit for cosmetics...... the PS5 blows away my PS4 PRO (my PS4 PRO is using an upgraded 2 TB SSD for more capacity and much faster access/read speed than a spinning hard drive).....Speaking of SSDs and upgrades; the PS4 used the common SATA 2.5\" internal SSD for upgrading capacity and speed. (But) The PS5 has a soldered in ~860GB internal SSD which can not be removed. Sony added one slot for expanding the hard drive capacity using rather a plug-in PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD over a conventional SATA connected hard drive. Thus, the PS5 allows you to not replace the original hard drive, but, to add an additional on-board SSD instead.Typically, the soldered-in or card type SSDs are a bit faster then using a SATA based protocol connection and given the PS5 requires a very fast solid state hard drive, they designed it so you install an additional PCIe type SSD over replacing just the single hard drive as it was done in the PS4.Be advised that (some) PS5 games take 2-3X more capacity then a PS4 game did. Perhaps why Sony designed the PS5 to add more capacity by using a second expansion slot rather then like the PS4 just having only one slot to use for the total capacity.Google PS5 SSD upgrades and there's much info out there regarding how many games you want to be able to store on the console and how large an upgrade you need to do accordingly!Everything on the PS5 is faster........everything......menu, access, games ...graphics are better in detail, clarity.......I could go on.The other thing the PS5 asks you to do when you first set it up is a complete setup for display for best gamma, brightness, contrast, color, etc......it takes you through a complete and easy set up to -maximize- the quality for display on your HDTV. It made a huge difference on my Samsung 65 inch 4K TV.5 Stars all around! Read the pro AND owner/user reviews on this new PS console. Yes, it is worth upgrading.The ps5 is a totally new and better gaming console. It's the first to be backward compatible with PS4 games, ...something my PS4 PRO would not allow for my PS3 games. So if you have a PS4 game collection, don't get rid of them!If you own a PS3, PS4 or PS4 PRO, yes, it is a worthwhile upgrade and substantial evolution for the PS Game Console series. You will not be sorry for upgrading and a big upgrade it will be!",

I think it is really nice that its becoming easier for everyone to get their hands on this because I know a lot of people still wants PS5's and I will be recommending Amazon as a source.

Only thing was is that mine got delayed about another 3 days so depending where you are, expect at least a 1 day delay or if not then you're fine.

    "text": "The good:- The new controller is awesome! I recommend playing the free Astro's Playroom tech demo game that shows off all the features. That game is way better than it has any right to be and is a great introduction to the controller's capabilities. I hope lots of future games utilize the DualSense controller to the same extent.- Backwards compatible with PS4 games. I have a large library of physical PS4 games, so it's great that I get to still enjoy them on the PS5 with improved performance. Some PS4 games like FF7 Remake even include a free PS5 upgrade. It was easy to migrate my games and save files from my PS4 with an external drive and PS Plus cloud saves.The bad:- WiFi connection is noticeably weaker than on the Xbox One X. I don't recommend using the online features unless you're using a wired connection. Even stuff like buying games in the PS Store is needlessly slow and unstable.- No themes or wallpapers. I liked to customize my PS4 with themes and custom wallpapers. Unfortunately the PS5 does not support that as of the writing of this review, so you're stuck with the boring default user interface.- Lack of exclusive games. Currently the PS5 does not have enough console-specific exclusives to make it stand out in today's gaming scene. The Demon's Souls remake and Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart are excellent, but we need more. I know we're also going to get FFXVI soon, but I doubt it will stay as a console exclusive for long.Overall:This is a great console, but I only recommend buying it for the backwards compatibility for gamers who own a lot of PS4 games. It's also worth getting if you don't already own a good gaming PC or an Xbox One X and want to play some next-gen games.",

    "text": "For those who actually care, there are three models of the PS5. A 1000, 1100 and 1200 series. The 1200 model actually uses less energy to prevent it from overheating and its lightest version of the PS5. In the product description it says this bundle comes with a 1100 model PS5. However, when I got mine it was actually the 1200 model. Which makes sense since it was so hard to keep PS5s in stock that most of the ones you see now WILL be the 1200 version unless you buy it used.I purchased mine when it went on sale for $509, which was an unbelievable price. That means you\u2019re getting God of War for $10! My only complaint is that Sony didn\u2019t put any special designs on the console or the controller to indicate this was a God of War bundle. Sony have released themed consoles in the past and I was hoping that this would be one. They actually did create a God of a War themed controller but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t come with the bundle, which is a shame because it\u2019s pretty cool looking.Lastly I\u2019m a person who used all of my Xbox\u2019s as media hubs for watching Tv and movies. After hearing how PS5s were overhearing I was worried about leaving my PS5 on all day. Though I just got my PS5, I have friends who use theirs in the same fashion and they have not had any issues from their system overheating. They use their systems to watch Tv and game, it\u2019s set to go in rest mode when it\u2019s not in use and they have yet to have any issues.I will say that if you are planning on getting a PS5 you may want to see what deals you can get on a compatible SSD. The PS5 only has a little under 700gb of storage and games(digital or physical) can take up a lot of storage. God of War takes up approximately 84 Gb of storage. Ultimately this is a great bundle and this is the perfect time to pick them up, while they are available and on sale.",

    "text": "As an avid gamer, I recently got my hands on the highly anticipated Sony PlayStation 5, and it has truly exceeded my expectations in terms of gaming performance, immersive experiences, and next-generation capabilities.Let\u2019s start with the hardware. The PlayStation 5 showcases a sleek and futuristic design that stands out in any gaming setup. The console boasts impressive power under the hood, thanks to its custom AMD Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 GPU. This powerful combination delivers stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, and faster load times, making for an unparalleled gaming experience. Whether you\u2019re exploring vast open worlds, engaging in intense multiplayer battles, or enjoying graphically demanding titles, the PlayStation 5 handles it all with ease.One of the standout features of the PlayStation 5 is its ultra-fast solid-state drive (SSD). This SSD drastically reduces load times, allowing for near-instantaneous game loading and seamless transitions between levels. It not only enhances convenience but also immerses players deeper into the gaming world by eliminating lengthy waiting periods.The DualSense wireless controller is a game-changer in itself. Its adaptive triggers and haptic feedback technology offer a new level of immersion and interactivity. The adaptive triggers provide varying levels of resistance, adding a realistic touch to actions like pulling a bowstring or accelerating a vehicle. The haptic feedback technology delivers precise and nuanced vibrations, making in-game actions and events feel more lifelike and engaging. It\u2019s a remarkable innovation that enhances the overall gaming experience and sets the PlayStation 5 apart from its predecessors.Another notable feature of the PlayStation 5 is its backward compatibility. It allows players to enjoy a vast library of PlayStation 4 games, preserving their existing game collections while also providing access to the new and exciting titles developed specifically for the PlayStation 5. This compatibility ensures a smooth transition to the next generation, offering gamers a wide range of options to choose from.The PlayStation 5\u2019s user interface is clean, intuitive, and user-friendly. Navigating through menus, accessing games, and managing settings are all seamless and straightforward. The console also provides a range of multimedia features, such as streaming apps and 4K Blu-ray playback, making it a versatile entertainment hub for your living room.While the PlayStation 5 delivers exceptional gaming experiences, it\u2019s worth noting that availability can be a challenge due to high demand. However, once you have it in your hands, it\u2019s undoubtedly a flagship gaming console that delivers on its promise of next-generation gaming.In conclusion, the Sony PlayStation 5 is a true powerhouse of gaming technology. With its impressive hardware, lightning-fast SSD, immersive controller, backward compatibility, and user-friendly interface, it provides an unmatched gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of what\u2019s possible.

Was sitting outside waiting when the driver arrived and placed the box next to me.  The tape was mostly pulled away from the top flaps. One side of the box was torn and the PS5 box was clearly visible.  My heart sank. Happily, I received a pristine PS5.  The Sony box doesn't have a mark or dent on it. The seal was intact and everything inside was untouched. (Sadly, the literature is in Spanish & French only.  Oops!)  The console booted normally and plays discs perfectly. Encountered none of the issues others recently described.This is truly money well spent. If you game a lot and want a better experience but haven't managed to pull the trigger, I say go for it!  I'm so happy with this console. It's absolutely better than PS4 and not just a little bit. I've been very happy with my PS4 and didn't expect wonders but the PS5 is a significant step up.==============================================================================TIPSIf your brand new PS5 isn't reading discs, don't panic. The optical scanner is on the outside of the slot, meaning that you must face the label in towards the console. For most people, it's counterintuitive. I unwittingly put the first disc in backwards and thought I had a console with a bad reader.  Nope.  It works fine.

(some screens only require that you press it once)Do not put your PS5 on a base with 'cooling fans' in it.  The PS5 pulls air in at the top and vents at the bottom. Bases with fans blow the hot air up and overheat the console. PS5 definitely does not run as hot as PS4. As long as there's breathing space around the PS5, it should be fine.Crashing - It's not constant but there's no way around it, especially if you're playing games that were originally created for PC. While PS5 is better than PS4 at rendering graphics, no PlayStation has the chops to render graphics like PCs with high end GPUs. The only PS games that have ever crashed on me are PC games that were ported to PlayStation. Happily, I've never lost data due to crashes.===================================================================Update June 6, 2023:Today one of my CD games (Stray) tried to update. The console kept throwing an error code (CE-10005-6) that it couldn't read the disc. It's a new disc with no scratches or fingerprints. Moreover, the PS5 read this disc/installed the game the day I received the console.  I knew it wasn't a disc issue so I laid the console on its side. Lo and behold, this time the PS5 read the disc.

    "text": "When I saw this for $510, essentially getting $50-$60 off God of War Ragnarok, I was very happy. I missed the original PS4 era and only recently got one second-hand to play all the Playstation exclusives. I blasted through them all and then was ready for PS5 exclusives like Rift Apart.-Having been a past digital-only console owner on the Xbox side, I will say this -- I believe in the advantages of physical games. Yes, most game disks currently only hold an access key to play a game and not the actual files for the game itself, BUT having a disk means having more options. You can resell a disk. You can hold it physically in your hand. You can trade it with friends. And, sort of a big thing -- if you ever lose your account for some reason, YOU DON'T LOSE ALL THE DIGITAL GAMES tied to your account.-My advice is don't get sucked into digital gaming just because it's cheaper to initially get a Series S or a digital PS5. You won't physically own any license keys to the games if you go digital. If Microsoft of PS5 servers or accounts ever go down, all your stuff gets lost. They already hold our game saves hostage -- remember when you used to be able to put saves on a flashdrive and not have them tied to your account? -- so don't let them hold your actual games hostage, too. This is my advice for a lot of media nowadays. Buy hard copies. Movies, music, games, books -- all of it. Otherwise, you're essentially paying ownership-level prices to rent electronically.-Why am I fine with a digital code for Ragnarok in this bundle? It is annoying -- I'd rather have a disk, BUT you can't get a disk for this game right now at the price of $10 (assuming you buy this bundle at the sale price of $510). If you're itching to play Ragnarok right now and feel like it's the right time to upgrade, this is the best deal. I imagine Ragnarok won't ever be on sale for $10 -- PS4 God of War still sells for like $20 by comparison, so this bundle is a great deal.-Not Amazon's fault, but I feel iffy about the white plastic. It looks cool and futuristic, but white plastic can get gross over time. I would suggest keeping the console and controller out of direct sunlight and having regular (gentle) cleanings. Not sure how I feel about protective decals at this time, but that middle black plastic bar of the console scratches super easily, so I'd say maybe consider a center decal sooner rather than later.--My console arrived neatly, not really anything to note. One white panel on it seems to have a faint scratch or mould mark, but it didn't really bother me or take away from the PS5 experience.-Hope this helps you all! Trying to give my honest opinion as someone who adores all sorts of games and all sorts of consoles. Good luck!",

It gives great performance that I was not expecting. At first, I wasn\u2019t too sure about the controller layout, since I have been an Xbox player my whole life, but when I got the hang of it I loved it. The controller has so many cool features, like the microphone, the speaker, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and the touchpad. And the exclusives? Those are so good! Spiderman miles morales was amazing, GOW ragnarok was great, and I loves Kratos\u2019s character development for his son. I started playing horizen forbidden west, and I\u2019m about 8 hours in. So far, it\u2019s a great game! But yeah, I love the ps5 and would definitely give it a 10/10",

    "text": "If there's a chance for you to order one of these and get 1-Day shipping, I highly recommend that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition and it worked amazingly well out-of-the-box. Overall 5 stars.In case there are any buyers out there that want one of these and are new to how they work, or want to know how to set it up best for their family, here are some things to know:1. The God of War Ragnark\u00f6k game comes as a digital code, so expect that versus the physical game (I thought it would be a disc, but that's probably because my expectations of bundles are still stuck in the PS3 era). I redeemed my code, but I've not loaded the game yet (when it's nearly 100 GB, I'm going to wait on this until I've earned the Platinum of Final Fantasy VII Remake).2. The controller works REALLY well and the charging cord is efficient, though if you can get a dedicated charging stand, that wouldn't hurt since the cord can sometimes be finicky. I think these can be purchased for $25ish, so if you have the cash to spare, that's a worthwhile addition (it also apparently helps the battery life of the controller).3. If you're new to how the PS5 works, here's one thing to keep in mind: PS5 games can only be played if they're stored in Console Storage. If you plug in an external drive, PS5 games stored there cannot be played. Doing that just saves you the hassle of reinstalling them. From what I under, internal storage is expandable, but you need to buy a special hard drive chip-thing dedicated for the PS5 to make this work. I've not invested in this yet, so if you stick to the storage you have, prioritize the PS5 games you want to play.3.5. If you use an external drive, have that be dedicated to your old PS4 games. They'll play like a dream.4. When it came to transferring console data, it was done within an evening for me. If you're starting fresh on the console, don't worry, but if you are transferring data from a PS4, expect to play your games to be playable in about 2-4 hours. Make sure to look up guides if you've never done the transfer before. Videos are also really good resources, too. Also, definitely use an ethernet cable to help with the process.5. Make sure Game Sharing is turned on if you have a family. This is buried in the settings, but if you find it, this will allow you to have the various profiles play the games the others have bought. Save you money from re-buying a game all over again.6. The disc drive can run loud when it's first loading up the game. It'll make you wonder, \"is it ok?!\" Don't worry. It is actually ok.Those are the big things I think are handy to be aware of before buying one of these. Overall, I have no complaints. It's done everything I've wanted it to and it's helped my brothers and I play together far more easily.",

    "text": "PS5Why it's great:1. UHD, QHD and FHD graphics brilliantly rendered at 60Hz (or higher with a pricey 120Hz monitor); more solid, seamless and textured characters and environments than ever to achieve greater immersion experiences2. Load times of 12-20 seconds for AAA games. No more minutes of waiting to play GTA, Witcher or COD.  Totally surpasses the PS4. PS4 compatible games load even faster and run smoother.2. Exclusives (God of War, FF VII remake, Gran Turismo, Demon Souls remake, Ratchet & Clank, Spider Man) , compatible with PS4 titles, AAA, indy and casual titles3. Transfer PS4 data4. Controller feels great, looks great, and battery-free; haptic feature simulates the feel of on-screen action (can be turned off)5. OS is easy and logical to use functions and apps quickly, voice command6. Fairly quiet, doesn't sound like a jet engine.7. Cross-play - play with PC and Xbox owners for certain titles, not all of themWhere it needs improvement:1. Size - as big or bigger than the PS32. Price - purchase, taxes, and one new game will cost near $600. Game are $65-70 in some cases.3. Online - online games restricted without PS Plus.4. Backwards compatibility - PS4 games only. PS3, 2 and 1 won't run.5. SSD is great but quickly fills up if you play lots of AAA games.6. Design - designed like a thick binder that's coming apart, not that it affects anything besides decor aesthetics7. Voice command - handles basic commands but can't do specific things like \"Load Gran Turismo\"",

    "text": "Short review!I'm not going to review the Amazon selection or delivery process. I'm just going to briefly review about why I upgraded to a PS5!First the negative....... my PRO was compact and reasonably designed in a flat symmetrical style......  The PS5 throws out the space saving rule book in favor of waves and advanced looking style and it'll not fit where your PS4 PRO was if it was in a tight space.Be aware that although the PS4 and PS4 PRO had 4K HDMI output for games, those PS4 models were limited to playing only 1080 Blu-Ray or regular definition DVDs.  The PS4 will not play 4K Blu-Ray disks. Why Sony left that feature out, who knows!  The good news is the PS5 DVD deck plays 4K movies to their full resolution. (as well of course as Blu-Ray 1080 and lower resolution/standard def DVDs). Now I only need my PS5 in the living room to cover it all rather then the 4K blu-ray player I had to use along with my PS4 PRO.I own several PS4 games and have yet to purchase any PS5 games.Let me say that my PS4 games play better on the PS5 then they did on the PS4 PRO. Graphics are superior, speed to access any menu or just in game play is much faster and these PS4 games take on a new and improved view on screen on my 65\" 4K hdtv!I can only imagine how great games specifically designed for the PS5 will be to view and play.My initial perspective on the PS5 compared to my PS4 PRO is that although the body design for the PS5 sacrifices space and fit for cosmetics...... the PS5 blows away my PS4 PRO (my PS4 PRO is using an upgraded 2 TB SSD for more capacity and much faster access/read speed than a spinning hard drive).....Speaking of SSDs and upgrades; the PS4 used the common SATA 2.5\" internal SSD for upgrading capacity and speed. (But) The PS5 has a soldered in ~860GB internal SSD which can not be removed. Sony added one slot for expanding the hard drive capacity using rather a plug-in PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD over a conventional SATA connected hard drive. Thus, the PS5 allows you to not replace the original hard drive, but, to add an additional on-board SSD instead.Typically, the soldered-in or card type SSDs are a bit faster then using a SATA based protocol connection and given the PS5 requires a very fast solid state hard drive, they designed it so you install an additional PCIe type SSD over replacing just the single hard drive as it was done in the PS4.Be advised that (some) PS5 games take 2-3X more capacity then a PS4 game did. Perhaps why Sony designed the PS5 to add more capacity by using a second expansion slot rather then like the PS4 just having only one slot to use for the total capacity.Google PS5 SSD upgrades and there's much info out there regarding how many games you want to be able to store on the console and how large an upgrade you need to do accordingly!Everything on the PS5 is faster........everything......menu, access, games ...graphics are better in detail, clarity.......I could go on.The other thing the PS5 asks you to do when you first set it up is a complete setup for display for best gamma, brightness, contrast, color, etc......it takes you through a complete and easy set up to -maximize- the quality for display on your HDTV. It made a huge difference on my Samsung 65 inch 4K TV.5 Stars all around! Read the pro AND owner/user reviews on this new PS console. Yes, it is worth upgrading.The ps5 is a totally new and better gaming console. It's the first to be backward compatible with PS4 games, ...something my PS4 PRO would not allow for my PS3 games. So if you have a PS4 game collection, don't get rid of them!If you own a PS3, PS4 or PS4 PRO, yes, it is a worthwhile upgrade and substantial evolution for the PS Game Console series. You will not be sorry for upgrading and a big upgrade it will be!",

I think it is really nice that its becoming easier for everyone to get their hands on this because I know a lot of people still wants PS5's and I will be recommending Amazon as a source.

Only thing was is that mine got delayed about another 3 days so depending where you are, expect at least a 1 day delay or if not then you're fine. I now just ordered a Digital PS5 Version to a family member of mine since I know I can just come to Amazon to purchase one. Great purchase overall and buy if you are interested.

It gives great performance that I was not expecting. At first, I wasn\u2019t too sure about the controller layout, since I have been an Xbox player my whole life, but when I got the hang of it I loved it. The controller has so many cool features, like the microphone, the speaker, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, and the touchpad. And the exclusives? Those are so good! Spiderman miles morales was amazing, GOW ragnarok was great, and I loves Kratos\u2019s character development for his son. I started playing horizen forbidden west, and I\u2019m about 8 hours in. So far, it\u2019s a great game! But yeah, I love the ps5 and would definitely give it a 10/10",

    "text": "If there's a chance for you to order one of these and get 1-Day shipping, I highly recommend that. Mine was delivered in perfect condition and it worked amazingly well out-of-the-box. Overall 5 stars.In case there are any buyers out there that want one of these and are new to how they work, or want to know how to set it up best for their family, here are some things to know:1. The God of War Ragnark\u00f6k game comes as a digital code, so expect that versus the physical game (I thought it would be a disc, but that's probably because my expectations of bundles are still stuck in the PS3 era). I redeemed my code, but I've not loaded the game yet (when it's nearly 100 GB, I'm going to wait on this until I've earned the Platinum of Final Fantasy VII Remake).2. The controller works REALLY well and the charging cord is efficient, though if you can get a dedicated charging stand, that wouldn't hurt since the cord can sometimes be finicky. I think these can be purchased for $25ish, so if you have the cash to spare, that's a worthwhile addition (it also apparently helps the battery life of the controller).3. If you're new to how the PS5 works, here's one thing to keep in mind: PS5 games can only be played if they're stored in Console Storage. If you plug in an external drive, PS5 games stored there cannot be played. Doing that just saves you the hassle of reinstalling them. From what I under, internal storage is expandable, but you need to buy a special hard drive chip-thing dedicated for the PS5 to make this work. I've not invested in this yet, so if you stick to the storage you have, prioritize the PS5 games you want to play.3.5. If you use an external drive, have that be dedicated to your old PS4 games. They'll play like a dream.4. When it came to transferring console data, it was done within an evening for me. If you're starting fresh on the console, don't worry, but if you are transferring data from a PS4, expect to play your games to be playable in about 2-4 hours. Make sure to look up guides if you've never done the transfer before. Videos are also really good resources, too. Also, definitely use an ethernet cable to help with the process.5. Make sure Game Sharing is turned on if you have a family. This is buried in the settings, but if you find it, this will allow you to have the various profiles play the games the others have bought. Save you money from re-buying a game all over again.6. The disc drive can run loud when it's first loading up the game. It'll make you wonder, \"is it ok?!\" Don't worry. It is actually ok.Those are the big things I think are handy to be aware of before buying one of these. Overall, I have no complaints. It's done everything I've wanted it to and it's helped my brothers and I play together far more easily.",

    "text": "PS5Why it's great:1. UHD, QHD and FHD graphics brilliantly rendered at 60Hz (or higher with a pricey 120Hz monitor); more solid, seamless and textured characters and environments than ever to achieve greater immersion experiences2. Load times of 12-20 seconds for AAA games. No more minutes of waiting to play GTA, Witcher or COD.  Totally surpasses the PS4. PS4 compatible games load even faster and run smoother.2. Exclusives (God of War, FF VII remake, Gran Turismo, Demon Souls remake, Ratchet & Clank, Spider Man) , compatible with PS4 titles, AAA, indy and casual titles3. Transfer PS4 data4. Controller feels great, looks great, and battery-free; haptic feature simulates the feel of on-screen action (can be turned off)5. OS is easy and logical to use functions and apps quickly, voice command6. Fairly quiet, doesn't sound like a jet engine.7. Cross-play - play with PC and Xbox owners for certain titles, not all of themWhere it needs improvement:1. Size - as big or bigger than the PS32. Price - purchase, taxes, and one new game will cost near $600. Game are $65-70 in some cases.3. Online - online games restricted without PS Plus.4. Backwards compatibility - PS4 games only. PS3, 2 and 1 won't run.5. SSD is great but quickly fills up if you play lots of AAA games.6. Design - designed like a thick binder that's coming apart, not that it affects anything besides decor aesthetics7. Voice command - handles basic commands but can't do specific things like \"Load Gran Turismo\"",

    "text": "Short review!I'm not going to review the Amazon selection or delivery process. I'm just going to briefly review about why I upgraded to a PS5!First the negative....... my PRO was compact and reasonably designed in a flat symmetrical style......  The PS5 throws out the space saving rule book in favor of waves and advanced looking style and it'll not fit where your PS4 PRO was if it was in a tight space.Be aware that although the PS4 and PS4 PRO had 4K HDMI output for games, those PS4 models were limited to playing only 1080 Blu-Ray or regular definition DVDs.  The PS4 will not play 4K Blu-Ray disks. Why Sony left that feature out, who knows!  The good news is the PS5 DVD deck plays 4K movies to their full resolution. (as well of course as Blu-Ray 1080 and lower resolution/standard def DVDs). Now I only need my PS5 in the living room to cover it all rather then the 4K blu-ray player I had to use along with my PS4 PRO.I own several PS4 games and have yet to purchase any PS5 games.Let me say that my PS4 games play better on the PS5 then they did on the PS4 PRO. Graphics are superior, speed to access any menu or just in game play is much faster and these PS4 games take on a new and improved view on screen on my 65\" 4K hdtv!I can only imagine how great games specifically designed for the PS5 will be to view and play.My initial perspective on the PS5 compared to my PS4 PRO is that although the body design for the PS5 sacrifices space and fit for cosmetics...... the PS5 blows away my PS4 PRO (my PS4 PRO is using an upgraded 2 TB SSD for more capacity and much faster access/read speed than a spinning hard drive).....Speaking of SSDs and upgrades; the PS4 used the common SATA 2.5\" internal SSD for upgrading capacity and speed. (But) The PS5 has a soldered in ~860GB internal SSD which can not be removed. Sony added one slot for expanding the hard drive capacity using rather a plug-in PCIe M.2 NVMe SSD over a conventional SATA connected hard drive. Thus, the PS5 allows you to not replace the original hard drive, but, to add an additional on-board SSD instead.Typically, the soldered-in or card type SSDs are a bit faster then using a SATA based protocol connection and given the PS5 requires a very fast solid state hard drive, they designed it so you install an additional PCIe type SSD over replacing just the single hard drive as it was done in the PS4.Be advised that (some) PS5 games take 2-3X more capacity then a PS4 game did. Perhaps why Sony designed the PS5 to add more capacity by using a second expansion slot rather then like the PS4 just having only one slot to use for the total capacity.Google PS5 SSD upgrades and there's much info out there regarding how many games you want to be able to store on the console and how large an upgrade you need to do accordingly!Everything on the PS5 is faster........everything......menu, access, games ...graphics are better in detail, clarity.......I could go on.The other thing the PS5 asks you to do when you first set it up is a complete setup for display for best gamma, brightness, contrast, color, etc......it takes you through a complete and easy set up to -maximize- the quality for display on your HDTV. It made a huge difference on my Samsung 65 inch 4K TV.5 Stars all around! Read the pro AND owner/user reviews on this new PS console. Yes, it is worth upgrading.The ps5 is a totally new and better gaming console. It's the first to be backward compatible with PS4 games, ...something my PS4 PRO would not allow for my PS3 games. So if you have a PS4 game collection, don't get rid of them!If you own a PS3, PS4 or PS4 PRO, yes, it is a worthwhile upgrade and substantial evolution for the PS Game Console series. You will not be sorry for upgrading and a big upgrade it will be!",

    "text": "This without a doubt is a great purchase and I will not regret buying one. I think it is really nice that its becoming easier for everyone to get their hands on this because I know a lot of people still wants PS5's and I will be recommending Amazon as a source. Specifically here since this is now a trusted source for me. Only thing was is that mine got delayed about another 3 days so depending where you are, expect at least a 1 day delay or if not then you're fine. I now just ordered a Digital PS5 Version to a family member of mine since I know I can just come to Amazon to purchase one. Great purchase overall and buy if you are interested. I'd say it is worth it.",

    "text": "I bought this PS5 for exclusives,  I got the GoW edition and all I can say is wow! I mainly game on PC I have a high end set up. The PS5 feels like a PC for the most part, it's smooth and loads games in seconds. I hardly notice a difference in performance, the graphics are well optimized and have great details. It's also quiet so far only making noise when booting up or downloading a game. The disc drive hardly makes any noise as well. It stays very cool in temperature it seems I can play it all day without it overheating.  Overall it's a very powerful gaming console well worth the money.",

    "text": "Beyond amazing, the PS5 is by far the most impressive gaming system to date. Graphics and sound are top notch and it also allows you to play ps4 and ps3 games with improved graphics. Additionally, some ps4 games can be upgraded to the ps5 version for free (such as Miles Morales) or for a small fee (such as Spider-Man). The 4K disc player makes this a must have and the exclusive games to date and to come are breathtaking. I can't recommend this system enough, just be sure to make room as it's a bit of a behemoth.",
