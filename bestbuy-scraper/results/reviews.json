    "text": "This is my first PlayStation console purchase after purchasing every competing console since the original PlayStation release. The packaging is minimalistic and cheap compared to the Xbox Series X and doesn't provide the same \"premium\" unboxing experience, but the most important part of the console is the gaming experience. After owning the Series X and being a Game Pass subscriber for two years, Spider-Man 2 was the first gaming experience that made me feel it could not have been possible on the previous generation. Load times are super quick or non-existent. However, the fans can be very loud, and the controller battery dies quickly. I find the stick layout to be inferior to the Xbox controller, as I frequently bump my thumbs together, so I purchased the Victrix modular controller that has an option to mimic the layout of the Xbox controller. I only purchase PlayStation exclusive games for it and appreciate that Sony releases disc versions of their games more than Microsoft, though I wish that the included Spider-Man 2 game were also a disc instead of a download.",
